# Wordfs webapp

<<<<<<< HEAD
A wordfs webapp - Find words from a matrix in a dfs fashion.

# NOTE: Important for developers

+ Part of the source code is maintained as a seperate branch "pack-for-npm". 
+ The reason for doing this is "Packaging the source cpp modules" as a library. So one can just include "require('wordfs')".
